            <p>	It wouldnâ€™t be long before Nook met with a terrible fate. In the city he was conforted by a sly fox who told him nothing but lies. The fox had promised Nook wealth beyond his imagination by means of investing in his sleazy business. Soon, Nook was robbed out of all of his life savings and belongings.
